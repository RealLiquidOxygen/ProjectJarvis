Websites that have banned, blocked and deleted white supremacists
Last weekendâ€™s â€œUnite the Rightâ€? rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, ostensibly a protest against the removal of a Confederate monument, drew hate groups that included neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members, white supremacists, and gun-wielding militias. The rally turned violent shortly after it began on the evening of August 11, when counter-protestors and rally attendees clashed with one another. The violence continued throughout the weekend, leaving one woman dead after a man drove his car at full speed into a large group of counter-protestors.&lt;/p&gt;

Each team's player with most to prove in NFL preseason Week 2
Training camp is in the rear-view mirror and roster cuts are right around the corner as we move into NFL preseason Week 2. With those cuts looming, the pressure is on for players to step up their games or be sent packing. Those are the players weâ€™re focusing on today. Guys who are already on the roster bubble and need to keep proving they belong. Guys who have done it before in this league but who are being chased by youngsters behind them on the depth chart. Guys who are supposed to be starters but who havenâ€™t impressed the manner in which they should. These players all need to prove they can hang with the big boys in Week 2.&lt;/p&gt;

These comments from Brady should scare opponents
Since turning the big 40 earlier in August, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has not lost a step. In fact, things are quite the opposite for Brady who had this to say when asked about training as a 40-year-old player. â€œNo. I think itâ€™s a lot easier now for me than itâ€™s ever been,â€? he said, per Phil Perry of CSN New England. â€œI feel like my routine is better than itâ€™s ever been. When youâ€™re younger you donâ€™t know what to do. After 17 years, going into my 18th year, I know what to do.â€? He makes a point about having years of experience. But, at the same time it almost seems as if Brady is superhuman. â€œI know how to prepare. Iâ€™m never sore. I could practice every day,â€? the future Hall of Famer said. â€œI could practice twice a day if theyâ€™d let us do that, but thatâ€™s not the way it goes anymore. Itâ€™s just fun being out here competing.â€? Really? No pain at all? I guess we will have to buy that considering Bradyâ€™s rigorous and detailed fitness program. The five-time Super Bowl champion quarterback eats meals from his own plant-based recipe book and will also be launching a self-help book next month (more on that here). Brady has no plans of retiring despite his wifeâ€™s pleas. Instead, the 40-year-old quarterback has plans to play into his mid 40s. At this rate, Brady might still be sporting a Patriots uniform when he celebrates his 50th birthday.

Saints fan trolls Falcons over SB loss with cleverly calculated tip

The Falcons of course blew a 28-3 third-quarter lead last February, ultimately losing to the New England Patriots in overtime by a score of 34-28 in stunning fashion. Well, some snarky Saints fan who happened to be dining out at an Atlanta restaurant decided to calculate his gratuity ...

Chicken breasts are not very exciting, but they are a versatile protein with a pretty healthy image, and for that reason people tend to buy and cook a lot of them.
