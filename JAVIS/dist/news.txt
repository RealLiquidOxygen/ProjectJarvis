Stephen King gets revenge on Donald Trump for blocking him
It, the â€œcanâ€™t sleep, clownâ€™ll eat meâ€? of movies, is expected to make a record-breaking amount of money in its first week of release. Anything less than $50 million would be considered a disappointment. Thatâ€™s particularly impressive considering, a) itâ€™s coming out in September, and b) itâ€™s an R-rated horror film. But thereâ€™s one person who canâ€™t see It on September 8, or ever. President Donald Trump blocked Stephen King on Twitter after the author tweeted, â€œMy newest horror story: Once upon a time there was a man named Donald Trump, and he ran for president. Some people wanted him to win.â€?

Theater cancels 'Gone With the Wind' screening: Film 'insensitive'
Gone With the Wind is now gone from The Orpheum Theatre in Memphis, Tennessee. The theaterâ€™s board deemed the 1939 film â€œinsensitiveâ€? to their larger audience after receiving â€œnumerous commentsâ€? that stemmed from a screening on Aug. 11. As such, the title has been dropped from next yearâ€™s planned summer movie series. â€œWhile title selections for the series are typically made in the spring of each year, the Orpheum has made this determination early in response to specific inquiries from patrons,â€? read a statement from The Orpheum Theatre Group. â€œThe Orpheum appreciates feedback on its programming from all members of the mid-south community. The recent screening of Gone With the Wind at the Orpheum on Friday, August 11, 2017, generated numerous comments. The Orpheum carefully reviewed all of them.â€? The statement continued, â€œAs an organization whose stated mission is to â€˜entertain, educate and enlighten the communities it serves,â€™ the Orpheum cannot show a film that is insensitive to a large segment of its local population.â€? Gone With the Wind, which won eight Academy Awards, features life on a Southern plantation during the Civil War and Reconstruction periods. Over the years, the subject matter has proven to be quite divisive for perpetuating a sympathetic view of the South during this time. As posted on the Orpheumâ€™s Facebook page event for the August screening, one user called the film â€œracist.â€? Another remarked over news of the canceled screening, â€œslowly but surely, we will rid this community of all tributes to white supremacy.â€? The Orpheum will be â€œannouncing an exciting movie series in the spring of 2018 that will, as always, contain both classic films and more recent blockbusters.â€?
